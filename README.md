## Services  
### Web Map Service (WMS)  
Basemap service in WMS format. Contains regularly updated data layers on roads, populated places, land use, hydrography, railroads, buildings and several types of 
points of interest, shown either as pictograms (as churches, hills, rail stations, airports) or as labels (governmental and municipal institutions, schools, supermarkets etc.).

### Tile Map Service (TMS)  
Basemap service in TMS format. Contains regularly updated data layers on roads, populated places, land use, hydrography, railroads, buildings and several types of 
points of interest, shown either as pictograms (as churches, hills, rail stations, airports) or as labels (governmental and municipal institutions, schools, supermarkets etc.). 
TMS suits perfectly to web map components for fast and dynamic map display and use.

### Geocoder  
Geocode API is a service for finding geographical coordinates and structured output for entered addresses. Service analyses the input text and responds by the list of address point candidates, ordered by relevance.

### Reverse geocoder  
Reverse Geocode API is for finding readable address or place name for geographical coordinates (point location).

### Address components  
Address component service (Gazetteer) is a tool for logical and mistake-free address search and saving. The unique address objects found can be saved to client's database with all necessary attributes and coordinates.  
  
It's also possible to request address component lists by levels (e.g. all streets of a defined settlement unit).
  
### Points of Interest
